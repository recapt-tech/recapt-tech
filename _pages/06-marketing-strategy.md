## Marketing Strategy

The SOSTAC ® marketing model, created by PR Smith, is a popular and widely used model for marketing and business planning. The model offers a logical order for tackling marketing plans, and can be used to assess the processes critically. It is an acronym for Smith's six fundamental facets of marketing: situation analysis, objectives, strategy, tactics, action and control.

### Situation Analysis

##### Company Outline

Recapt is founded in Stockholm by five EIT Innovation and KTH students. With tagline “Capture your expenses”, Recapt positioning itself as an easy to use and simple application that helps users follow a budget. The other value propositions are its cross platform and customizable charts. Since it is still in the early stage of startup, Recapt has a lack of brand awareness at this point.

##### Customer Outline

1. Ordinary users who are interested in tracking their expenses, with age range from early 20 to mid 40 which usually techno savvy people. They live in developing countries and developed countries, with middle income to upper middle income economies. 

2. Small businesses who want an affordable digital solution for all of their paper receipts, usually startups and businesses that work in technology.

##### Competitor Outline

1. Expensify

Expensify is an expense reporting app that targets both corporate and end clients. Once users photograph receipts, artificial intelligence identifies the merchant, date and amount of the transaction, then automatically categorizes and saves the expense. But it doesn’t give itemized details of the purchase. Expensify has a good reputation and brand awareness.

2. Snapcart

Snapcart is a gamified receipt scanner app that will give cashback in return for grocery/marts and pharmacy stores’ receipts. They compete with Recapt with regards to itemized detail technology, not on business solution. It will create user expectation in terms of technology to at least have the same performance as existing apps.

3. Google Sheets/ Microsoft Excel

They do not directly compete with Recapt, but many people manually input their expenditure on Google Sheets/ Microsoft Excel to track expense history. Not only they have high brand awareness, these two giants are the icons of the technology.

##### Environmental Factors

*Economic forces*

In developing countries, many people have the need to be able to manage their spending as they face the need to get a better living standard. While most people in developed countries such as Sweden where managing their spending is not a priority, environmental awareness can be a reason to be conscious buyers. However, most of these expense tracking has occurred on paper or Excel sheet. As the pandemic occurred, a weak, slow-growth economy forces trend is expected to continue and most people begin to focus more on the “value” they receive from their spending. The expense tracking application provides more detail information to help people get this value.

*Political forces*

There are no expected political influences or events that could affect the operations of Recapt.

*Legal and regulatory forces*

In recent years, more attention has been paid to GDPR and the security of network and information systems. A large percentage of expense tracking application is collecting sensitive information both to the users and to business owners. Although Recapt can guarantee to comply with said regulations, the users’ trust needs to build and maintain to be able to give a feeling of security when using the application. While new regulation may be introduced to ensure data privacy and security, all the expense tracking application will naturally have some speed bumps.

*Technological forces*

A major emerging technological trend involves Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a tool that enabled a lot of task including expense tracking to be able to make it run automatically. As this trend continues, current software-based products may have to be adapted to match the new technology and gain advantages of it.

*Sociocultural forces*

In today’s society, users have less time for an application that requires user actions such as manual input. The hallmarks of today’s successful products are convenience and ease of use. In short, if the product does not save time and is not easy to use, users will simply ignore it. Application-based expense tracking fit this user need quite well. An application-based expense tracking also fits in with other societal trends: a move to a paperless society, the need to automate repetitive tasks, and the growing dependence on mobile phones, for example.


### SWOT Analysis

##### Strengths

* A small size company promotes  quick response to users’ needs.
* Implemented easy to use UI and itemized data as users’ request with competitive pricing.

##### Weaknesses

* Haven't been established as a reputable expense tracking app  (no review on app store yet).
* To operate the business will require funds from either loans or investors.
* At this stage, Recapt depends only on one product.

##### Opportunities

* The market is huge since there are no geographical boundaries and still growing because not many people use autonomous expense tracking at this time.
* Could maximize partnership with KTH and EIT Digital.

##### Threats

* Inability to migrate user data from competitors in the same business could discourage users to try a similar application, making conversion from competitor seems impossible.
* Initial poor service or product quality could discourage users from returning.
* Whenever the related regulations are updated, we need to develop solutions that meet the standards.

### Objectives

Recapt is in the business of helping people track their expenses. Besides formulating a solution for easy-to-use itemized tracking, Recapt should establish an objective to build brand awareness by having popularity at least the first two pages of searching results when using keywords of competitor’s brand, as well as some other top keywords. The more people remember the brand, the more likely they are to directly type it in the search bar. In other words, visit Recapt website proactively. 

The major marketing objective is to generate new users and gain a better understanding of their needs and satisfaction through marketing research. Recapt can improve the products it now offers through knowledge of its users’ needs and specific opportunities for new product offerings. Recapt also should create new features that can utilize its current equipment, technology, and knowledge base. Since Recapt is a small size company, improving product line and even changing business strategies will be easier to do.

Another objective should be to analyze the paying users to determine if there are ways to keep users paying monthly subscription by offering package prices for several months at a time. Alternatively, paying and repeat users might be willing to join the referral program to get other clients in return for discounts or added customer services. To accomplish its marketing objectives, Recapt should develop benchmarks to measure progress. Regular reviews of these objectives will provide feedback and possible corrective actions on a timely basis. 

### Strategy

##### Marketing Mix

In order to devise strategies and do marketing efficiently, Recapt need to keep the four P’s of marketing mix in mind: product, place, price, and promotion.

*Product*

Recapt is an expense tracking application of specialty providing itemized data to its users. Recapt’s intangible attributes are its ability to hear user feedback, its speed in responding to users’ demands, and its anticipation of new user needs. Intangible attributes are difficult for competitors to copy, thereby giving Recapt a competitive advantage.

*Place*

The application can be downloaded from the app store with the operating system iOS and Android. Monthly subscription can be done directly in the application.

*Price*

Recapt used an affordable pricing strategy and can vary by region. In addition, Recapt differentiates prices for individuals and enterprises. This is intended to get a high market share from business.

*Promotion*

We believe this business has seasonal trends in demand and will have peaks in the end of year to new year since people become aware of the importance of expense tracking. Riding the trends, Recapt will focus its promotional in that period of time using advertisement on social media.

##### Online Marketing Strategy

Most users go online these days to find and/or review new products and/or services to purchase. As such, having the right online marketing strategy can help secure new users and gain competitive advantage.

The four key components to online marketing strategy are as follows:

1. Keyword Strategy: identify what keywords would like to optimize for the website to gain popularity.

2. Search Engine Optimization Strategy: plan ahead updates Recapt will make to the website so it shows up more prominently for top keywords.

3. Paid Online Advertising Strategy: write down the online advertising programs will be used to reach target users.

4. Social Media Strategy: plan ahead how Recapt will use social media websites to attract users.

##### Conversion Strategy

Conversion strategies refer to the techniques that can be employed to turn prospective users into paying users. Conversion can be boosted by improving sales scripts or increasing social proof (e.g., showing testimonials of past users who were satisfied with Recapt).

##### Referral Strategy

A strong user referral program could revolutionize success. For example, if every one of the users referred one new user, the user base would constantly grow. However, such growth  will rarely be achieved unless Recapt have a formalized referral strategy. For example, determining the best time to ask users for referrals and what will be/ how much the reward for the users.

##### Retention Strategy

Retention strategies refer to techniques that invest in getting existing paying users to subscribe more often or becoming repeat users. By using retention strategies such as a monthly newsletter or user loyalty program, Recapt can increase revenues and profits by getting users to subscribe more frequently over time.

### Tactics

##### Values Matrix

A values matrix helps prioritize all the tactics that have come up with when measuring the strategies on it. Essentially, it helps choose the tactics that have the highest business value and take the least amount of resources to implement.

![value-matrix](/assets/content/value-matrix.png)

Business “value” depends on strategic objectives while implementation “complexity” encompasses the time it takes to implement, internal resources needed, and design costs.

* High-value, low-complexity: “Easy wins” that should be considered for plan.
* High-value, high-complexity: Larger strategic initiatives that require effort and time but pay enormous dividends.
* Low-value, low-complexity: Might or might not be worth the time. Revisit these features later or brainstorm ways to make them of higher value.
* Low-value, high-complexity: Items that should be deprioritized.

##### Marketing Plan

Tactics explain how to implement the strategy. In this marketing plan we will schedule the better alternatives to implement than others at achieving strategy goals based on the values matrix.

![marketing-plan](/assets/content/marketing-plan.png)

##### Budget

The total budget for the referral program, christmas campaign, new year resolution campaign, and the user survey will be equal to 80 percent of the annual promotional budget for the coming year.

The breakdown of the budget within the project will be a 20 percent allocation to the referral program, a 30 percent allocation to christmas campaign, a 30 percent allocation to new year resolution campaign, and a 20 percent allocation to new feature/ product line development based on user survey.

### Action

##### Website

Website is part of keyword strategy and SEO strategy. This tactic will allow two marketing objectives to achieve, build a brand awareness by increasing traffic and generate more paying users. Certain keywords have more impact on those objectives than others. For Recapt, it makes sense to focus on both product and niche keywords. Initially, Recapt has to create keyword lists then prioritize each list of keywords according to importance for achieving objectives. Elseway, Recapt can analyze the average monthly searches, competition, and difficulty, and choose the ones that will be easiest to rank.

To run this tactic efficiently, use the chosen keywords in the website's content by putting these in page title, meta description, URL, headline, image name, and at least a few times in the body copy (including in subheadlines). The keywords don’t necessarily need to be in the exact order. Besides, Recapt need to build internal links. Internal linking is supposed to help search engines cruise around the website. This is an opportunity to focus on prospective users and direct them from new posts to some of the best content we’ve ever published.

##### Blogging

Creating content would be hard with limited man-hours. Recapt could overcome this limitation in several ways including content curation and guest bloggers. Content curation means gathering the most interesting posts on the subject or industry from other sources and adding commentary or insight and putting them into a blog post. Make sure to always give credit to the original source. Besides, we can ask guest writers by sending them a message to see if they’re interested in writing on our blog. These approaches will ease our workload. Blogging tactic will be carried out in conjunction with website tactics, which will complement each other in presenting high value contents. 

##### Social media
After having a clear idea of what is already on the website or blog, the next most fundamental step is to determine which channels to create fresh content for. With so many different platforms available, Recapt decided to focus only on one channel, Facebook page, because it can deliver the most impact for the business and that we have time to comfortably invest in.

To get more engagement rate, Recapt will focus to share infographics and interactive contents on social media. Infographics are incredibly engaging. It uses the power of visually appealing content to trick the brain into reading. According to one survey, the data in infographics have more virality than presentations and documents. Meanwhile, interactive content normally refers to content which responds to the user’s actions such as quiz, moving image, animation, video, audio, or games.

##### Monthly newsletter

To save time building e-newsletters, Recapt can repurposing blog and social media content. Because of this nature, the first newsletter can only be delivered a month after the first blog content posted. Additionally, Recapt can provide a rich user experience by asking any user’s stories to be featured in the next issue of the newsletter. It also provides a higher engagement rate. Moreover, a monthly newsletter can also be used as an invitation to user surveys to know better users’ needs and specific opportunities for new product offerings.

##### Referral program

Referral program is intended for paying users and repeat users to get an offer on subscription fees if they succeed in getting prospective users to be able to subscribe. New users will also get the same benefit if using the referral code given by existing users. The program is carried out in conjunction with Recapt’s campaigns to maximize the effect of user’s conversions.

##### Christmas campaign

This campaign aims to increase brand recognition and get new users by utilizing the momentum where people use large funds to be able to give gifts. The campaign is carried out by making new promotional videos that emphasize financial planning and paid advertisement on social media.

##### New year resolution campaign

This campaign aims to increase brand recognition and get new users by utilizing the momentum where many people have a new year's resolution to have more control in their expenses. The campaign is carried out by making new promotional videos that emphasize capturing the expenses and paid advertisement on social media.

### Control

##### Performance Standards and Financial Controls

A comparison of the financial expenditures with the plan goals will be included in the project report. The following performance standards and financial controls are suggested:

1. Each project team is responsible for reporting all financial expenditures, including direct expenses, for their segment of the project. A standardized reporting form will be developed and provided by the marketing director.
2. The marketing director is responsible for adherence to the project budget and will report overages to the company president on a biweekly basis. The marketing director also is responsible for any redirection of budget spending.
3. The Christmas campaign and new year resolution campaign will be evaluated two months after launch to determine its profitability. 

##### Monitoring Procedures

To analyze the effectiveness of Recapt’s marketing plan, it is necessary to compare its actual performance with plan objectives. To facilitate this analysis, monitoring procedures should be developed for the various activities required to bring the marketing plan to fruition. These procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. A project management concept will be used to evaluate the implementation of the marketing plan by establishing time requirements, human resource needs, and financial or budgetary expenditures.
2. A perpetual comparison of actual and planned activities will be conducted on a monthly basis. The business analysis team, including the marketing director, will report their comparison of actual and planned outcomes directly to the company president.
3. Each project team is responsible for determining what changes must be made in procedures, product focus, or operations as a result of the studies conducted in its area.
