# How Will This Venture Continue?

### Time Investment

The venture will need six months to check the viability of the company and six more months to deliver all planned products. Out of all the surveys that have been done before, we still need one more survey to tune in and add extra milestones in the MVP version of our product. The development of this market-ready app is estimated to be done in mid July and ready to install by users in the marketplace. We will conduct an evaluation in September, two months after release, to learn what features can be developed in order to establish a new product, enterprise edition. Meanwhile, we will have startup tours to pitch our product from July to November and expect to get first funding in November as required to run our planned activities.

From mid November to the end of February, the venture will run massive marketing campaigns in order to grow its customer base and have active communication with the community. Along with that, we plan to develop enterprise versions from November to April, then start marketing this product to the companies in May. Meanwhile, another team will focus on store partnership from November to May.

Considering that three out of five founders of the venture will leave Sweden from the next upcoming academic semester, the division of work and even the continuity of the venture will be hard. In case of any founder leaving the venture, we will need to find its substitute so the plan is still up and running.

### Upcoming Activities and Expected Outcomes

In order for this venture to continue to grow, we need to keep working on it. There are a number of activities planned for the next period that will help grow our customer base and solidify our position in the market. The next table summarizes the most important of these activities.

### Uncertainty in Times of The COVID-19 Virus

Entrepreneurs have been greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. One might say that the current situation is the ultimate entrepreneurial test as this ordeal has forced many businesses to continuously adapt in order to survive. 

The coronavirus pandemic has affected a number of areas and activities. For starters, working and interacting with customers in person is no longer an option.  This means it is no longer possible to go to a busy train station to conduct a live customer survey.

Furthermore, As everyone has been hit economically, many businesses are laying off personnel or cutting unnecessary expenditure, hence, it becomes more challenging to sell to companies because you have to convince them that this will have a direct measurable positive effect on the bottom line.

However, as more people are practicing social distancing and there is a growing fear of travelling and human contact, it gives a fertile ground for startups that will provide virtual alternatives to everyday activities. For instance, the current pandemic has catalyzed the growth of many ecommerce websites.

For a startup to survive the current situation it needs to understand three things: 

1. first, a startup needs to do a thorough review of all expenses where any non essential expenses must be cut in order to provide the longest runway. 
2. This crisis is an opportunity to be more innovative and calls for more creative problem solving which is at the core of the entrepreneurial spirit. 
3. This crisis is causing a technology push where more things are going digital (e.g. education, governments, etc.), a startup needs to more quickly and take advantage of this transformation to have a competitive advantage over its competitors.

On a positive note, no crisis can last forever and It should be noted that, entrepreneurs are fighters by nature, they are resilient when faced with great odds.
