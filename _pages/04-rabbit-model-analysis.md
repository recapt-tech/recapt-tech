# Rabbit Model Analysis

For any startup to be successful in this day and age it needs to be highly adaptable to the ever-changing situation; not just locally but on a global scale. Not only that but a startup, or any company, needs to predict what changes or new player that might enter the market in the future that would affect the dynamics of the market and the role of the different player.

For this venture, we have identified three major points that might affect the market, namely, the transition to a cashless society, the prefoliation of online ordering and delivery of grocery and the end of paper receipts. In the next sections we will discuss each of these points and how we are preparing to adopt to them.

### Cashless Society

In a cashless society financial transaction are no longer conducted with physical banknotes but rather digitally. More electronic payment systems appear each year like PayPal, Google Pay or payment by smartphone via NFC.

Sweden is one of the countries that is closest to a full transition to a cashless society[^footnote]. It is estimated that over 80% of the population use a digital payment form and between 2016 and 2018 card payments increased by 25%. As such, they are very close to a complete switch.

At first glance, the relationship between the use of banknotes and expense tracking might not be very clear. But it shows a trend of people preferring the digital format including receipts and hence the whole premise of the venture (receipt scanning) might be at risk but it is also an opportunity because currently there is no digital replacement for the physical receipt.

It is true that most stores and supermarkets allow you to create some sort of loyalty account and receive digital receipts on each purchase. However, this solution does not scale because it means that a user needs to have multiple accounts for every possible store that might use. A more practical and scalable solution is needed one that allows preserving the anonymity of the customer.

A similar success story, that is also Swedish, is Swish which is a mobile payment system that was born due to the need for an easier money transfer system. For example, if you are out with friends and it is time to split the bill each one would pay there share in cash. But as Sweden is becoming more digital, paying a share means sharing bank details and each person users their own bank which probably as different interface and sometimes requires different field. Hence, Swish was a solution that is as simple as giving someone your phone number. What also contributed to its success was that it was started as a corporation between six large banks.

As such, the solution needs to be a technical solution that is simple to use but also a corporation between large stores and supermarket chains so that it gains enough momentum and large-scale adoption. Our venture can significantly benefit by designing and working the technical solution before the actual needs arises. 

### Online Grocery Stores

Another key player that is affecting the market is the increase use of online grocery shopping and delivery. These businesses growth will be amplified by the current world situation and the spread of the COVID-19 virus as more people go into self-quarantine. Albeit these services are very convenient they simple shift the problem of managing printout receipts into digital receipts in email where you have to sift through and categorize manually.

Hence, even though the format and channels are different the premise of the app, managing you purchasing history, still remains. However, it needs to be adapted to serve this new customer needs before another player enters the market.

One idea is to develop some sort of a browser plugin that automatically detects receipts in your mailbox and passes them along to the app to be processed and indexed. This way the app can serve both segments printout receipt scanning and email receipts.

### End of Paper Receipts

Paper receipts are relics from a different time; they have to go away at some point. Because smartphones have become a ubiquitous part of everyday life it stands to reason that they will be replaced by some smartphone functionality. Perhaps future receipts can be transferred via Near Field Communication (NFC) technology or maybe a less complicated solution is QR code scanning which just needs a camera and can work on a large number of phone models. Regardless of the technology that is going to replace paper receipts there must be a transition period until the new technology is fully adopted and accepted by society as the new norm. 

The best solution right now that serves as a middle ground is receipt scanning to get all the benefits of having a digital copy of receipts while still keeping a physical copy if needed. This venture can be a market leader during this transition period and help accelerate the process due to advances that has been done by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and specifically Deep Learning (DL) over the last few years. 

The benefits of this solution are more obvious in the case of business customers because for tax and legal reasons they need to keep their expenses which can be expensive in the case of paper receipts. Business can be skeptical of new solutions and they want to use trusted solutions and by allowing them to still keep their physical receipts alongside a digital copy this reduces their perceived risks.
