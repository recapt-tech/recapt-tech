# Methodology and Work Process

A key to the success of a venture is following a continuous cycle of prototyping and seeking customer feedback so that customers opinions are an integral part of the design from the get go. During the development of this venture we followed the same approach.

### Ideation

As part of the ideation phase, a market survey was conducted among KTH master students to see the potential for the receipt scanning app. The next figure shows a screenshot from the survey.  More than 95% of the respondents agreed that paper receipts are needs to be come digital.

Based on these results a prototype was then developed that contained the minimal set of features for it to be a usable product. Furthermore, we made a “How to” video showing actual footage of the app usage. This video had two main purposes: (1) to be used to create brand awareness on social media and (2) to use it when surveying the customers again about the prototype. 

As an aside, due to the ongoing virus situation, it is difficult to talk directly to customers and showing a “How to” video is the next best thing to actually having the opportunity to interact with the app.

### Design Iteration

We conducted a more thorough survey to understand what our customers like or dislike about our app. The survey wanted to assess the problem validity (do people care about financial management? do they want a tool to automate it? etc.) and solution validity (do people like the core features? Are any important features missing? etc.).

The survey results indicated that 68.4% think that financial management is very important and  55.3% of respondents have practiced at least one form of financial management. Furthermore,   44.7% think that tracking expenses in details (line level) is very important and at least 39.5% keep a record of the original receipt while 31.6% keep the receipt and maintain a record of it.

The results indicate a high preference for recording and tracking expenses, however, the survey revealed that the number one customer pain point (60.5%) find the process very time consuming and that it takes a lot of effort.

In addition, the survey showed general positive reactions towards our initial prototype.   89.5% of respondents thought that the automatic item detection feature was the most important feature, 36.8% thought that the customizable charts was most important while 44.7% favored the price comparison feature. The next figure shows the top most important features based on the survey results.

Moreover, the survey showed that 44.7% of respondents would actively  use our product if it were available on the market and at least 55.3% had a willingness to pay depending on the price point.

### The Final Prototype

The results of this survey were analyzed and used to reach the MVP version of our product. In this version of the product, a number of bug fixes were introduced in addition to enhancement to the overall app performance and the item detection algorithm.

As before, another survey was conducted to understand what our customers like or dislike about the updated user interface. The survey also asked the participants about what they think is the most important feature and what feature they think needed improvement.

From the survey results, on a scale of (1-5), 38.5% gave the app a score 5/5 for understandability of the app and 61.5% gave it a score of 4/5. In addition, respondents gave the app a generally positive review score and at least 80% are likely to recommend the app to a friend.
